# String waves

As you navigate on the web page, the straight diagonal hatching becomes a sea of undulating strings following your cursor. 
As the waves grow, the content peeking through the lines is revealed. 
The string waves were built with a custom shader material that creates an original curve and lighting relative to the cursor proximity and 
direction and replicates it infinitely along the strings to create the illusion of waves.
Built in Three.js and React
